(** * The [apply] Tactic *)

(** We can use [apply] when some hypothesis or an earlier
    lemma exactly matches the goal: *)

Theorem silly1 : forall (n m o p : nat),
     n = m  ->
     [n;o] = [n;p] ->
     [n;o] = [m;p].
Proof.
  intros n m o p eq1 eq2.
  rewrite <- eq1.

(** Here, we could finish with "[rewrite -> eq2.  reflexivity.]" as we
    have done several times before.  We can finish this proof in
    a single step by using the [apply] tactic instead: *)

  apply eq2.  Qed.

(** [apply] also works with _conditional_ hypotheses: *)

Theorem silly2 : forall (n m o p : nat),
    n = m ->
    (n = m -> [n;o] = [m;p]) ->
    [n;o] = [m;p].
Proof.
  intros n m o p eq1 eq2.
  apply eq2. apply eq1.  Qed.

(** Observe how Coq picks appropriate values for the
    [forall]-quantified variables of the hypothesis: *)

Theorem silly2a : forall (n m : nat),
     (n,n) = (m,m)  ->
     (forall (q r : nat), (q,q) = (r,r) -> [q] = [r]) ->
     [n] = [m].
Proof.
  intros n m eq1 eq2.
  apply eq2. apply eq1.  Qed.

(** The goal must match the hypothesis _exactly_ for [apply] to
    work: *)

Theorem silly3_firsttry : forall (n : nat),
     true = (n =? 5)  ->
     (S (S n)) =? 7 = true.
Proof.
  intros n H.

(** Here we cannot use [apply] directly, but we can use the [symmetry]
    tactic, which switches the left and right sides of an equality in
    the goal. *)

  symmetry.
  simpl. (** (This [simpl] is optional, since [apply] will perform
             simplification first, if needed.) *)
  apply H.  Qed.

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * The [apply with] Tactic *)

(** The following silly example uses two rewrites in a row to
    get from [[a;b]] to [[e;f]]. *)

Example trans_eq_example : forall (a b c d e f : nat),
     [a;b] = [c;d] ->
     [c;d] = [e;f] ->
     [a;b] = [e;f].
Proof.
  intros a b c d e f eq1 eq2.
  rewrite -> eq1. rewrite -> eq2. reflexivity.  Qed.

(** Since this is a common pattern, we might like to pull it out
    as a lemma recording, once and for all, the fact that equality is
    transitive. *)

Theorem trans_eq : forall (X:Type) (n m o : X),
  n = m -> m = o -> n = o.
Proof.
  intros X n m o eq1 eq2. rewrite -> eq1. rewrite -> eq2.
  reflexivity.  Qed.

(** Applying this lemma to the example above requires a slight
    variation on [apply]: *)

Example trans_eq_example' : forall (a b c d e f : nat),
     [a;b] = [c;d] ->
     [c;d] = [e;f] ->
     [a;b] = [e;f].
Proof.
  intros a b c d e f eq1 eq2.

  (** Doing [apply trans_eq] doesn't work!  But... *)
  apply trans_eq with (m:=[c;d]).
  (** does. *)

  apply eq1. apply eq2.   Qed.

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * The [injection] and [discriminate] Tactics *)

(** In Coq, the constructors of inductive types are _injective_
    and _disjoint_.

    E.g., for [nat]...

    - if [S n = S m] then it must hold that [n = m] (that is, [S] is
      _injective_ aka _one-to-one_)

    - [O] is not equal to [S n] for any [n] (that is, [O] and [S] are
      _disjoint_)
 *)

(** For example, we can prove the injectivity of [S] by using the
    [pred] function defined in [Basics.v]. *)

Theorem S_injective : forall (n m : nat),
  S n = S m ->
  n = m.
Proof.
  intros n m H1.
  assert (H2: n = pred (S n)). { reflexivity. }
  rewrite H2. rewrite H1. reflexivity.
Qed.

(** As a convenience, the [injection] tactic allows us to
    exploit injectivity of any constructor. *)

Theorem S_injective' : forall (n m : nat),
  S n = S m ->
  n = m.
Proof.
  intros n m H.
  injection H. intros Hnm. apply Hnm.
Qed.

(** Here's a more interesting example that shows how [injection] can
    derive multiple equations at once. *)

Theorem injection_ex1 : forall (n m o : nat),
  [n; m] = [o; o] ->
  [n] = [m].
Proof.
  intros n m o H.
  injection H. intros H1 H2.
  rewrite H1. rewrite H2. reflexivity.
Qed.

(** The "[as]" variant of [injection] permits us to choose names for
    the equations and immediately introduce them as hypotheses, rather
    than as premises. The original equality, in this case [H], is
    also removed from the hypotheses with this variant. *)

Theorem injection_ex2 : forall (n m : nat),
  [n] = [m] ->
  n = m.
Proof.
  intros n m H.
  injection H as Hnm. rewrite Hnm.
  reflexivity. Qed.

(** So much for injectivity of constructors.  What about disjointness?

    The principle of disjointness says that two terms beginning with
    different constructors (like [O] and [S], or [true] and [false])
    can never be equal.  This means that, any time we find ourselves
    working in a context where we've _assumed_ that two such terms are
    equal, we are justified in concluding anything we want to (because
    the assumption is nonsensical).

    The [discriminate] tactic embodies this principle: It is used on a
    hypothesis involving an equality between different
    constructors (e.g., [S n = O]), and it solves the current goal
    immediately.  For example: *)

Theorem eqb_0_l : forall n,
   0 =? n = true -> n = 0.
Proof.
  intros n.

  destruct n as [| n'] eqn:E.
  - (* n = 0 *)
    intros H. reflexivity.

  - (* n = S n' *)
    simpl.

    intros H. discriminate H.
Qed.

(** This is an instance of a logical principle known as the _principle
    of explosion_, which asserts that a contradictory hypothesis
    entails anything, even false things! *)

Theorem discriminate_ex1 : forall (n : nat),
  S n = O ->
  2 + 2 = 5.
Proof.
  intros n contra. discriminate contra. Qed.

Theorem discriminate_ex2 : forall (n m : nat),
  false = true ->
  [n] = [m].
Proof.
  intros n m contra. discriminate contra. Qed.

(* QUIZ 

    Suppose Coq's proof state looks like

         1 subgoals, subgoal 1

         x : bool
         y : bool
         H : negb x = negb y
         ============================
          y = x

    and we apply the tactic [injection H].  What will happen?

    (1) "No more subgoals."

    (2) The tactic fails.

    (3) None of the above.
*)
(* /QUIZ *)

(** The injectivity of constructors allows us to reason that
    [forall (n m : nat), S n = S m -> n = m].  The converse of this
    implication is an instance of a more general fact about both
    constructors and functions, which we will find convenient in a few
    places below: *)

Theorem f_equal : forall (A B : Type) (f: A -> B) (x y: A),
  x = y -> f x = f y.
Proof. intros A B f x y eq. rewrite eq.  reflexivity.  Qed.

Theorem eq_implies_succ_equal : forall (n m : nat),
    n = m -> S n = S m.
Proof. intros n m H. apply f_equal. apply H. Qed.

(** Or use tactic [f_equal]. *)

Theorem eq_implies_succ_equal' : forall (n m : nat),
    n = m -> S n = S m.
Proof. intros n m H. f_equal. apply H. Qed.

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Using Tactics on Hypotheses *)

(** Many tactics come with "[... in ...]" variants that work on
    hypotheses instead of goals. *)

Theorem S_inj : forall (n m : nat) (b : bool),
     (S n) =? (S m) = b  ->
     n =? m = b.
Proof.
  intros n m b H. simpl in H. apply H.  Qed.

(** The ordinary [apply] tactic is a form of "backward
    reasoning": it says "We're trying to prove [X] and we know
    [Y -> X], so if we can prove [Y] we'll be done."

    By contrast, the variant [apply... in...] is "forward reasoning":
    it says "We know [Y] and we know [Y -> X], so we also know [X]." *)

Theorem silly3' : forall (n : nat),
  (n =? 5 = true -> (S (S n)) =? 7 = true) ->
  true = (n =? 5)  ->
  true = ((S (S n)) =? 7).
Proof.
  intros n eq H.
  symmetry in H. apply eq in H. symmetry in H.
  apply H.  Qed.

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Varying the Induction Hypothesis *)

(** Recall this function for doubling a natural number (from the
    [Induction] chapter): *)

Fixpoint double (n:nat) :=
  match n with
  | O => O
  | S n' => S (S (double n'))
  end.

(** Suppose we want to show that [double] is injective -- i.e.,
    that it maps different arguments to different results.  The
    way we _start_ this proof is a little bit delicate: *)

Theorem double_injective_FAILED : forall n m,
     double n = double m ->
     n = m.
Proof.
  intros n m. induction n as [| n' IHn'].
  - (* n = O *) simpl. intros eq. destruct m as [| m'] eqn:E.
    + (* m = O *) reflexivity.
    + (* m = S m' *) discriminate eq.
  - (* n = S n' *) intros eq. destruct m as [| m'] eqn:E.
    + (* m = O *) discriminate eq.
    + (* m = S m' *) apply f_equal.

(** At this point, the induction hypothesis, [IHn'], does _not_ give us
    [n' = m'] -- there is an extra [S] in the way -- so the goal is
    not provable. *)

Abort.
(** What went wrong? *)

(** Trying to carry out this proof by induction on [n] when [m] is
    already in the context doesn't work because we are then trying to
    prove a statement involving _every_ [n] but just a _single_ [m]. *)

(** The successful proof of [double_injective] leaves [m] in the goal
    statement at the point where the [induction] tactic is invoked on
    [n]: *)

Theorem double_injective : forall n m,
     double n = double m ->
     n = m.
Proof.
  intros n. induction n as [| n' IHn'].
  - (* n = O *) simpl. intros m eq. destruct m as [| m'] eqn:E.
    + (* m = O *) reflexivity.
    + (* m = S m' *) discriminate eq.

  - (* n = S n' *) simpl.
    intros m eq.
    destruct m as [| m'] eqn:E.
    + (* m = O *) simpl.
      discriminate eq.

    + (* m = S m' *)
      apply f_equal.
      apply IHn'. injection eq as goal. apply goal. Qed.

(** What you should take away from all this is that we need to be
    careful, when using induction, that we are not trying to prove
    something too specific: To prove a property of [n] and [m] by
    induction on [n], it is sometimes important to leave [m]
    generic. *)

(** The following theorem illustrates the same point: *)

Theorem eqb_true : forall n m,
    n =? m = true -> n = m.
Proof.
  (* WORK IN CLASS *) Admitted.

(** In addition to being careful about how you use [intros], practice using "in" 
    variants in this proof.  (Hint: use  [plus_n_Sm].) *)
Theorem plus_n_n_injective : forall n m,
     n + n = m + m ->
     n = m.
Proof.
  intros n. induction n as [| n'].
  (* WORK IN CLASS *) Admitted.

(** The strategy of doing fewer [intros] before an [induction] to
    obtain a more general IH doesn't always work by itself; sometimes
    some _rearrangement_ of quantified variables is needed.  Suppose,
    for example, that we wanted to prove [double_injective] by
    induction on [m] instead of [n]. *)

Theorem double_injective_take2_FAILED : forall n m,
     double n = double m ->
     n = m.
Proof.
  intros n m. induction m as [| m' IHm'].
  - (* m = O *) simpl. intros eq. destruct n as [| n'] eqn:E.
    + (* n = O *) reflexivity.
    + (* n = S n' *) discriminate eq.
  - (* m = S m' *) intros eq. destruct n as [| n'] eqn:E.
    + (* n = O *) discriminate eq.
    + (* n = S n' *) apply f_equal.
        (* Stuck again here, just like before. *)
Abort.

(** The problem is that, to do induction on [m], we must first
    introduce [n].  (If we simply say [induction m] without
    introducing anything first, Coq will automatically introduce [n]
    for us!)  *)

(** What can we do about this?  One possibility is to rewrite the
    statement of the lemma so that [m] is quantified before [n].  This
    works, but it's not nice: We don't want to have to twist the
    statements of lemmas to fit the needs of a particular strategy for
    proving them!  Rather we want to state them in the clearest and
    most natural way. *)

(** What we can do instead is to first introduce all the quantified
    variables and then _re-generalize_ one or more of them,
    selectively taking variables out of the context and putting them
    back at the beginning of the goal.  The [generalize dependent]
    tactic does this. *)

Theorem double_injective_take2 : forall n m,
     double n = double m ->
     n = m.
Proof.
  intros n m.
  (* [n] and [m] are both in the context *)
  generalize dependent n.
  (* Now [n] is back in the goal and we can do induction on
     [m] and get a sufficiently general IH. *)

    + (* n = O *) discriminate eq.
    + (* n = S n' *) apply f_equal.
      apply IHm'. injection eq as goal. apply goal. Qed.

(** Digression: Let's use [eqb_true] to prove a similar
    property of identifiers that we'll need later: *)

Theorem eqb_id_true : forall x y,
  eqb_id x y = true -> x = y.
Proof.
  intros [m] [n]. simpl. intros H.
  assert (H' : m = n). { apply eqb_true. apply H. }
  rewrite H'. reflexivity.
Qed.

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Unfolding Definitions *)

(** It sometimes happens that we need to manually unfold a name that
    has been introduced by a [Definition] so that we can manipulate
    its right-hand side.  For example, if we define... *)

Definition square n := n * n.

(** ... and try to prove a simple fact about [square]... *)

Lemma square_mult : forall n m, square (n * m) = square n * square m.
Proof.
  intros n m.
  simpl.

(** ... we appear to be stuck: [simpl] doesn't simplify anything at
    this point, and since we haven't proved any other facts about
    [square], there is nothing we can [apply] or [rewrite] with.

    To make progress, we can manually [unfold] the definition of
    [square]: *)

  unfold square.

(** Now we have plenty to work with: both sides of the equality are
    expressions involving multiplication, and we have lots of facts
    about multiplication at our disposal.  In particular, we know that
    it is commutative and associative, and from these it is not hard
    to finish the proof. *)

  rewrite mult_assoc.
  assert (H : n * m * n = n * n * m).
    { rewrite mult_comm. apply mult_assoc. }
  rewrite H. rewrite mult_assoc. reflexivity.
Qed.

(** At this point, some discussion of unfolding and simplification is
    in order.

    You may already have observed that tactics like [simpl],
    [reflexivity], and [apply] will often unfold the definitions of
    functions automatically when this allows them to make progress.
    For example, if we define [foo m] to be the constant [5]... *)

Definition foo (x: nat) := 5.

(** .... then the [simpl] in the following proof (or the
    [reflexivity], if we omit the [simpl]) will unfold [foo m] to
    [(fun x => 5) m] and then further simplify this expression to just
    [5]. *)

Fact silly_fact_1 : forall m, foo m + 1 = foo (m + 1) + 1.
Proof.
  intros m.
  simpl.
  reflexivity.
Qed.

(** However, this automatic unfolding is somewhat conservative.  For
    example, if we define a slightly more complicated function
    involving a pattern match... *)

Definition bar x :=
  match x with
  | O => 5
  | S _ => 5
  end.

(** ...then the analogous proof will get stuck: *)

Fact silly_fact_2_FAILED : forall m, bar m + 1 = bar (m + 1) + 1.
Proof.
  intros m.
  simpl. (* Does nothing! *)
Abort.

(** The reason that [simpl] doesn't make progress here is that it
    notices that, after tentatively unfolding [bar m], it is left with
    a match whose scrutinee, [m], is a variable, so the [match] cannot
    be simplified further.  It is not smart enough to notice that the
    two branches of the [match] are identical, so it gives up on
    unfolding [bar m] and leaves it alone.  Similarly, tentatively
    unfolding [bar (m+1)] leaves a [match] whose scrutinee is a
    function application (that cannot itself be simplified, even
    after unfolding the definition of [+]), so [simpl] leaves it
    alone. *)

(** At this point, there are two ways to make progress.  One is to use
    [destruct m] to break the proof into two cases, each focusing on a
    more concrete choice of [m] ([O] vs [S _]).  In each case, the
    [match] inside of [bar] can now make progress, and the proof is
    easy to complete. *)

Fact silly_fact_2 : forall m, bar m + 1 = bar (m + 1) + 1.
Proof.
  intros m.
  destruct m eqn:E.
  - simpl. reflexivity.
  - simpl. reflexivity.
Qed.

(** This approach works, but it depends on our recognizing that the
    [match] hidden inside [bar] is what was preventing us from making
    progress. *)

(** A more straightforward way to make progress is to explicitly tell
    Coq to unfold [bar]. *)

Fact silly_fact_2' : forall m, bar m + 1 = bar (m + 1) + 1.
Proof.
  intros m.
  unfold bar.

(** Now it is apparent that we are stuck on the [match] expressions on
    both sides of the [=], and we can use [destruct] to finish the
    proof without thinking too hard. *)

  destruct m eqn:E.
  - reflexivity.
  - reflexivity.
Qed.

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Using [destruct] on Compound Expressions *)

(** The [destruct] tactic can be used on expressions as well as
    variables: *)

Definition sillyfun (n : nat) : bool :=
  if n =? 3 then false
  else if n =? 5 then false
  else false.

Theorem sillyfun_false : forall (n : nat),
  sillyfun n = false.
Proof.
  intros n. unfold sillyfun.
  destruct (n =? 3) eqn:E1.

    - (* n =? 3 = false *) destruct (n =? 5) eqn:E2.
      + (* n =? 5 = true *) reflexivity.
      + (* n =? 5 = false *) reflexivity.  Qed.

(** The [eqn:] part of the [destruct] tactic is optional: We've chosen
    to include it most of the time, just for the sake of
    documentation, but many Coq proofs omit it.

    When [destruct]ing compound expressions, however, the information
    recorded by the [eqn:] can actually be critical: if we leave it
    out, then [destruct] can sometimes erase information we need to
    complete a proof. *)

Definition sillyfun1 (n : nat) : bool :=

  else if n =? 5 then true

Theorem sillyfun1_odd_FAILED : forall (n : nat),
