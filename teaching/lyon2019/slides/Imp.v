(** * Imp: Simple Imperative Programs *)

(** In this chapter, we take a more serious look at how to use Coq to
    study other things.  Our case study is a _simple imperative
    programming language_ called Imp, embodying a tiny core fragment
    of conventional mainstream languages such as C and Java.  Here is
    a familiar mathematical function written in Imp.

       Z ::= X;;
       Y ::= 1;;
       WHILE ~(Z = 0) DO
         Y ::= Y * Z;;
         Z ::= Z - 1
       END
*)

(** We concentrate here on defining the _syntax_ and _semantics_ of
    Imp; later chapters in _Programming Language Foundations_
    (_Software Foundations_, volume 2) develop a theory of
    _program equivalence_ and introduce _Hoare Logic_, a widely
    used logic for reasoning about imperative programs. *)

(** * Arithmetic and Boolean Expressions *)

(** We'll present Imp in three parts: first a core language of
    _arithmetic and boolean expressions_, then an extension of these
    expressions with _variables_, and finally a language of _commands_
    including assignment, conditions, sequencing, and loops. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Syntax *)

Module AExp.

(** _Abstract syntax trees_ for arithmetic and boolean expressions: *)

Inductive aexp : Type :=
  | ANum (n : nat)
  | APlus (a1 a2 : aexp)
  | AMinus (a1 a2 : aexp)
  | AMult (a1 a2 : aexp).

Inductive bexp : Type :=
  | BTrue
  | BFalse
  | BEq (a1 a2 : aexp)
  | BLe (a1 a2 : aexp)
  | BNot (b : bexp)
  | BAnd (b1 b2 : bexp).

(** For comparison, here's a conventional BNF (Backus-Naur Form)
    grammar defining the same abstract syntax:

    a ::= nat
        | a + a
        | a - a
        | a * a

    b ::= true
        | false
        | a = a
        | a <= a
        | ~ b
        | b && b
*)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Evaluation *)

(** _Evaluating_ an arithmetic expression produces a number. *)

Fixpoint aeval (a : aexp) : nat :=
  match a with
  | ANum n => n
  | APlus  a1 a2 => (aeval a1) + (aeval a2)
  | AMinus a1 a2 => (aeval a1) - (aeval a2)
  | AMult  a1 a2 => (aeval a1) * (aeval a2)
  end.

Example test_aeval1:
  aeval (APlus (ANum 2) (ANum 2)) = 4.
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.

(** Similarly, evaluating a boolean expression yields a boolean. *)

Fixpoint beval (b : bexp) : bool :=
  match b with
  | BTrue       => true
  | BFalse      => false
  | BEq a1 a2   => (aeval a1) =? (aeval a2)
  | BLe a1 a2   => (aeval a1) <=? (aeval a2)
  | BNot b1     => negb (beval b1)
  | BAnd b1 b2  => andb (beval b1) (beval b2)
  end.

  | APlus (ANum 0) e2 => optimize_0plus e2
  | APlus  e1 e2 => APlus  (optimize_0plus e1) (optimize_0plus e2)
  | AMinus e1 e2 => AMinus (optimize_0plus e1) (optimize_0plus e2)

(** * Coq Automation *)

(** That last proof was getting a little repetitive.  Time to
    learn a few more Coq tricks... *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Tacticals *)

(** _Tacticals_ is Coq's term for tactics that take other tactics as
    arguments -- "higher-order tactics," if you will.  *)

(* ----------------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** The [try] Tactical *)

(** If [T] is a tactic, then [try T] is a tactic that is just like [T]
    except that, if [T] fails, [try T] _successfully_ does nothing at
    all (rather than failing). *)

Theorem silly1 : forall ae, aeval ae = aeval ae.
Proof. try reflexivity. (* This just does [reflexivity]. *) Qed.

Theorem silly2 : forall (P : Prop), P -> P.
Proof.
  intros P HP.
  try reflexivity. (* Just [reflexivity] would have failed. *)
  apply HP. (* We can still finish the proof in some other way. *)
Qed.

(* ----------------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** The [;] Tactical (Simple Form) *)

(** In its most common form, the [;] tactical takes two tactics as
    arguments.  The compound tactic [T;T'] first performs [T] and then
    performs [T'] on _each subgoal_ generated by [T]. *)

(** For example: *)

Lemma foo : forall n, 0 <=? n = true.
Proof.
  intros.
  destruct n.
    (* Leaves two subgoals, which are discharged identically...  *)
    - (* n=0 *) simpl. reflexivity.
    - (* n=Sn' *) simpl. reflexivity.
Qed.

(** We can simplify this proof using the [;] tactical: *)

Lemma foo' : forall n, 0 <=? n = true.
Proof.
  intros.
  (* [destruct] the current goal *)
  destruct n;
  (* then [simpl] each resulting subgoal *)
  simpl;
  (* and do [reflexivity] on each resulting subgoal *)
  reflexivity.
Qed.

(** Using [try] and [;] together, we can get rid of the repetition in
    the proof that was bothering us a little while ago. *)

Theorem optimize_0plus_sound': forall a,
  aeval (optimize_0plus a) = aeval a.
Proof.
  intros a.
  induction a;
    (* Most cases follow directly by the IH... *)
    try (simpl; rewrite IHa1; rewrite IHa2; reflexivity).
    (* ... but the remaining cases -- ANum and APlus --
       are different: *)
  - (* ANum *) reflexivity.
  - (* APlus *)
    destruct a1 eqn:Ea1;
      (* Again, most cases follow directly by the IH: *)
      try (simpl; simpl in IHa1; rewrite IHa1;
           rewrite IHa2; reflexivity).
    (* The interesting case, on which the [try...]
       does nothing, is when [e1 = ANum n]. In this
       case, we have to destruct [n] (to see whether
       the optimization applies) and rewrite with the
       induction hypothesis. *)
    + (* a1 = ANum n *) destruct n eqn:En;
      simpl; rewrite IHa2; reflexivity.   Qed.

(* ----------------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** The [repeat] Tactical *)

(** The [repeat] tactical takes another tactic and keeps applying this
    tactic until it fails. Here is an example showing that [10] is in
    a long list using repeat. *)

Theorem In10 : In 10 [1;2;3;4;5;6;7;8;9;10].
Proof.
  repeat (try (left; reflexivity); right).
Qed.

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Defining New Tactic Notations *)

(** Coq also provides several ways of "programming" tactic scripts:
     - [Tactic Notation]: syntax extension for tactics (good for
       simple macros)
     - [Ltac]: scripting language for tactics (good for more
       sophisticated proof engineering)
     - OCaml tactic scripting API (for wizards)

An example [Tactic Notation]: *)

Tactic Notation "simpl_and_try" tactic(c) :=
  simpl;
  try c.

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** The [omega] Tactic *)

(** The [omega] tactic implements a decision procedure for a subset of
    first-order logic called _Presburger arithmetic_.  It is based on
    the Omega algorithm invented by William Pugh [Pugh 1991] (in Bib.v).

    If the goal is a universally quantified formula made out of

      - numeric constants, addition ([+] and [S]), subtraction ([-]
        and [pred]), and multiplication by constants (this is what
        makes it Presburger arithmetic),

      - equality ([=] and [<>]) and ordering ([<=]), and

      - the logical connectives [/\], [\/], [~], and [->],

    then invoking [omega] will either solve the goal or fail, meaning
    that the goal is actually false.  (If the goal is _not_ of this
    form, [omega] will also fail.) *)

Example silly_presburger_example : forall m n o p,
  m + n <= n + o /\ o + 3 = p + 3 ->
  m <= p.
Proof.
  intros. omega.
Qed.

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** A Few More Handy Tactics *)

(** Finally, here are some miscellaneous tactics that you may find
    convenient.

     - [clear H]: Delete hypothesis [H] from the context.

     - [subst x]: For a variable [x], find an assumption [x = e] or
       [e = x] in the context, replace [x] with [e] throughout the
       context and current goal, and clear the assumption.

     - [subst]: Substitute away _all_ assumptions of the form [x = e]
       or [e = x] (where [x] is a variable).

     - [rename... into...]: Change the name of a hypothesis in the
       proof context.  For example, if the context includes a variable
       named [x], then [rename x into y] will change all occurrences
       of [x] to [y].

     - [assumption]: Try to find a hypothesis [H] in the context that
       exactly matches the goal; if one is found, behave like [apply
       H].

     - [contradiction]: Try to find a hypothesis [H] in the current
       context that is logically equivalent to [False].  If one is
       found, solve the goal.

     - [constructor]: Try to find a constructor [c] (from some
       [Inductive] definition in the current environment) that can be
       applied to solve the current goal.  If one is found, behave
       like [apply c].

    We'll see examples of all of these as we go along. *)

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Evaluation as a Relation *)

(** We have presented [aeval] and [beval] as functions defined by
    [Fixpoint]s.  Another way to think about evaluation -- one that we
    will see is often more flexible -- is as a _relation_ between
    expressions and their values.  This leads naturally to [Inductive]
    definitions like the following one for arithmetic expressions... *)

Module aevalR_first_try.

Inductive aevalR : aexp -> nat -> Prop :=
  | E_ANum n :
      aevalR (ANum n) n
  | E_APlus (e1 e2: aexp) (n1 n2: nat) :
      aevalR e1 n1 ->
      aevalR e2 n2 ->
      aevalR (APlus e1 e2) (n1 + n2)
  | E_AMinus (e1 e2: aexp) (n1 n2: nat) :
      aevalR e1 n1 ->
      aevalR e2 n2 ->

         := (aevalR e n)
            (at level 50, left associativity)
         : type_scope.

End aevalR_first_try.

(** If we "reserve" the notation in advance, we can even use it
    in the definition: *)

Reserved Notation "e '\\' n" (at level 90, left associativity).

Inductive aevalR : aexp -> nat -> Prop :=

      (e1 \\ n1) -> (e2 \\ n2) -> (AMult e1 e2) \\ (n1 * n2)

  where "e '\\' n" := (aevalR e n) : type_scope.

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Inference Rule Notation *)

(** For example, the constructor [E_APlus]...

      | E_APlus : forall (e1 e2: aexp) (n1 n2: nat),
          aevalR e1 n1 ->
          aevalR e2 n2 ->
          aevalR (APlus e1 e2) (n1 + n2)

    ...would be written like this as an inference rule:

                               e1 \\ n1
                               e2 \\ n2
                         --------------------                (E_APlus)
                         APlus e1 e2 \\ n1+n2
*)

(** There is nothing very deep going on here:
      - the rule name corresponds to a constructor name
      - above the line are premises
      - below the line is conclusion
      - _metavariables_ like [e1] and [n1] are implicitly universally
        quantified
      - the whole collection of rules is implicitly wrapped in an
        [Inductive] (sometimes we write this slightly more explicitly,
        as "...closed under these rules...") *)

(** ** Equivalence of the Definitions *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Computational vs. Relational Definitions *)

(** We have seen that we can use either relations or functions
    to give a semantics (meaning) for evaluation, with different
    tradeoffs.

    But in general, relational semantics, being lower level and more
    flexible, are sometimes the only reasonable option... *)

(** Extending the definition of [aeval] to handle this new operation

    of [ADiv (ANum 5) (ANum 0)]?).  But extending [aevalR] is
    straightforward. *)

(* ----------------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Tradeoffs *)

(** At this point you maybe wondering: which style should I use by
    default?  In the examples we've just seen, relational definitions
    turned out to be more useful than functional ones.  For situations
    like these, where the thing being defined is not easy to express
    as a function, or indeed where it is _not_ a function, there is no
    real choice.  But what about when both styles are workable?

    One point in favor of relational definitions is that they can be
    more elegant and easier to understand.

    Another is that Coq automatically generates nice inversion and
    induction principles from [Inductive] definitions. *)

(** On the other hand, functional definitions can often be more
    convenient:
     - Functions are by definition deterministic and defined on all
       arguments; for a relation we have to show these properties
       explicitly if we need them.
     - With functions we can also take advantage of Coq's computation
       mechanism to simplify expressions during proofs.

    Furthermore, functions can be directly "extracted" from Gallina to
    executable code in OCaml or Haskell. *)

(** Ultimately, the choice often comes down to either the specifics of
    a particular situation or simply a question of taste.  Indeed, in
    large Coq developments it is common to see a definition given in
    _both_ functional and relational styles, plus a lemma stating that
    the two coincide, allowing further proofs to switch from one point
    of view to the other at will. *)

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Expressions With Variables *)

(** Back to defining Imp.  The next thing we need to do is to enrich
    our arithmetic and boolean expressions with variables.  To keep
    things simple, we'll assume that all variables are global and that
    they only hold numbers. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** States *)

(** Since we'll want to look variables up to find out their current
    values, we'll reuse maps from the [Maps] chapter, and
    [string]s will be used to represent variables in Imp.

    A _machine state_ (or just _state_) represents the current values
    of _all_ variables at some point in the execution of a program. *)

Definition state := total_map nat.

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Syntax  *)

(** We can add variables to the arithmetic expressions we had before by
    simply adding one more constructor: *)

  | ANum (n : nat)
  | AId (x : string)              (* <--- NEW *)
  | APlus (a1 a2 : aexp)
  | AMinus (a1 a2 : aexp)
  | AMult (a1 a2 : aexp).

(** Defining a few variable names as notational shorthands will make
    examples easier to read: *)

Definition W : string := "W".
Definition X : string := "X".
Definition Y : string := "Y".
Definition Z : string := "Z".

(** The definition of [bexp]s is unchanged (except that it now refers
    to the new [aexp]s): *)

  | BFalse
  | BEq (a1 a2 : aexp)
  | BLe (a1 a2 : aexp)
  | BNot (b : bexp)
  | BAnd (b1 b2 : bexp).

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Notations *)

(** To make Imp programs easier to read and write, we introduce some
    notations and implicit coercions.

    You do not need to understand exactly what these declarations do.
    Briefly, though, the [Coercion] declaration in Coq stipulates that
    a function (or constructor) can be implicitly used by the type
    system to coerce a value of the input type to a value of the
    output type.  For instance, the coercion declaration for [AId]
    allows us to use plain strings when an [aexp] is expected; the
    string will implicitly be wrapped with [AId]. *)

(** The notations below are declared in specific _notation scopes_, in
    order to avoid conflicts with other interpretations of the same
    symbols.  Again, it is not necessary to understand the details,
    but it is important to recognize that we are defining _new_
    interpretations for some familiar operators like [+], [-], [*],
    [=], [<=], etc. *)

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Commands *)

(** Now we are ready define the syntax and behavior of Imp
    _commands_ (sometimes called _statements_). *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Syntax *)

(** Informally, commands [c] are described by the following BNF
    grammar.

     c ::= SKIP | x ::= a | c ;; c | TEST b THEN c ELSE c FI
         | WHILE b DO c END

    (We choose this slightly awkward concrete syntax for the
    sake of being able to define Imp syntax using Coq's notation
    mechanism.  In particular, we use [TEST] to avoid conflicting with
    the [if] and [IF] notations from the standard library.) 
    For example, here's factorial in Imp:

     Z ::= X;;
     Y ::= 1;;
     WHILE ~(Z = 0) DO
       Y ::= Y * Z;;
       Z ::= Z - 1
     END

   When this command terminates, the variable [Y] will contain the
   factorial of the initial value of [X]. *)

Inductive com : Type :=
  | CSkip
  | CAss (x : string) (a : aexp)
  | CSeq (c1 c2 : com)
  | CIf (b : bexp) (c1 c2 : com)
  | CWhile (b : bexp) (c : com).

(** As for expressions, we can use a few [Notation] declarations to
    make reading and writing Imp programs more convenient. *)

Bind Scope imp_scope with com.
Notation "'SKIP'" :=
   CSkip : imp_scope.
Notation "x '::=' a" :=
  (CAss x a) (at level 60) : imp_scope.
Notation "c1 ;; c2" :=
  (CSeq c1 c2) (at level 80, right associativity) : imp_scope.
Notation "'WHILE' b 'DO' c 'END'" :=
  (CWhile b c) (at level 80, right associativity) : imp_scope.
Notation "'TEST' c1 'THEN' c2 'ELSE' c3 'FI'" :=
  (CIf c1 c2 c3) (at level 80, right associativity) : imp_scope.

(** *** Imp Factorial in Coq 

    For example, here is the factorial function again, written as a
    formal definition to Coq: *)

Definition fact_in_coq : com :=
  (Z ::= X;;
  Y ::= 1;;
  WHILE ~(Z = 0) DO
    Y ::= Y * Z;;
    Z ::= Z - 1
  END)%imp.

  X ::= X - 1.

(* ----------------------------------------------------------------- *)

Definition loop : com :=
  WHILE true DO

  END.

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Evaluating Commands *)

(** Next we need to define what it means to evaluate an Imp command.
    The fact that [WHILE] loops don't necessarily terminate makes
    defining an evaluation function tricky... *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Evaluation as a Function (Failed Attempt) *)

(** Here's an attempt at defining an evaluation function for commands,
    omitting the [WHILE] case. *)

Open Scope imp_scope.
Fixpoint ceval_fun_no_while (st : state) (c : com)
                          : state :=
  match c with
    | SKIP =>
        st
    | x ::= a1 =>
        (x !-> (aeval st a1) ; st)
    | c1 ;; c2 =>
        let st' := ceval_fun_no_while st c1 in
        ceval_fun_no_while st' c2
    | TEST b THEN c1 ELSE c2 FI =>
        if (beval st b)
          then ceval_fun_no_while st c1
          else ceval_fun_no_while st c2
    | WHILE b DO c END =>
        st  (* bogus *)
  end.
Close Scope imp_scope.

(* ----------------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Nontermination leads to Inconsistency 

     Consider the following "proof object":

        Fixpoint loop_false (n : nat) : False :=
          loop_false n.

     Accepting such a definition would be catastrophic, so Coq
     conservatively rejects _all_ nonterminating programs.
*)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Evaluation as a Relation *)

(** Here's a better way: define [ceval] as a _relation_ rather than a
    _function_ -- i.e., define it in [Prop] instead of [Type], as we
    did for [aevalR] above. *)

(** We'll use the notation [st =[ c ]=> st'] for the [ceval] relation:
    [st =[ c ]=> st'] means that executing program [c] in a starting
    state [st] results in an ending state [st'].  This can be
    pronounced "[c] takes state [st] to [st']". *)

(** * Additional Exercises *)

(** **** Exercise: 3 stars, standard (stack_compiler)  

    Old HP Calculators, programming languages like Forth and Postscript,
    and abstract machines like the Java Virtual Machine all evaluate
    arithmetic expressions using a _stack_. For instance, the expression

      (2*3)+(3*(4-2))

   would be written as

      2 3 * 3 4 2 - * +

   and evaluated like this (where we show the program being evaluated
   on the right and the contents of the stack on the left):

      [ ]           |    2 3 * 3 4 2 - * +
      [2]           |    3 * 3 4 2 - * +
      [3, 2]        |    * 3 4 2 - * +
      [6]           |    3 4 2 - * +
      [3, 6]        |    4 2 - * +
      [4, 3, 6]     |    2 - * +
      [2, 4, 3, 6]  |    - * +
      [2, 3, 6]     |    * +
      [6, 6]        |    +
      [12]          |

  The goal of this exercise is to write a small compiler that
  translates [aexp]s into stack machine instructions.

  The instruction set for our stack language will consist of the
  following instructions:
     - [SPush n]: Push the number [n] on the stack.
     - [SLoad x]: Load the identifier [x] from the store and push it
                  on the stack
     - [SPlus]:   Pop the two top numbers from the stack, add them, and
                  push the result onto the stack.
     - [SMinus]:  Similar, but subtract.
     - [SMult]:   Similar, but multiply. *)

Inductive sinstr : Type :=
| SPush (n : nat)
| SLoad (x : string)
| SPlus
| SMinus
| SMult.

(** Write a function to evaluate programs in the stack language. It
    should take as input a state, a stack represented as a list of
    numbers (top stack item is the head of the list), and a program
    represented as a list of instructions, and it should return the
    stack after executing the program.  Test your function on the
    examples below.

    Note that the specification leaves unspecified what to do when
    encountering an [SPlus], [SMinus], or [SMult] instruction if the
    stack contains less than two elements.  In a sense, it is
    immaterial what we do, since our compiler will never emit such a
    malformed program. *)

                   (prog : list sinstr)
                 : list nat

       [SPush 4; SLoad X; SMult; SPlus]
   = [15; 4].
(* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.

(** Next, write a function that compiles an [aexp] into a stack
    machine program. The effect of running the program should be the
    same as pushing the value of the expression on the stack. *)

(** **** Exercise: 4 stars, advanced (stack_compiler_correct)  

    Now we'll prove the correctness of the compiler implemented in the
    previous exercise.  Remember that the specification left
    unspecified what to do when encountering an [SPlus], [SMinus], or
    [SMult] instruction if the stack contains less than two
    elements.  (In order to make your correctness proof easier you
    might find it helpful to go back and change your implementation!)

    Prove the following theorem.  You will need to start by stating a
    more general lemma to get a usable induction hypothesis; the main
    theorem will then be a simple corollary of this lemma. *)
