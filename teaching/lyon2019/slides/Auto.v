(** * The [auto] Tactic *)

(** Thus far, our proof scripts mostly apply relevant hypotheses or
    lemmas by name, and one at a time. *)

Example auto_example_1 : forall (P Q R: Prop),
  (P -> Q) -> (Q -> R) -> P -> R.
Proof.
  intros P Q R H1 H2 H3.
  apply H2. apply H1. assumption.
Qed.

(** The [auto] tactic frees us from this drudgery by _searching_ for a
    sequence of applications that will prove the goal: *)

Example auto_example_1' : forall (P Q R: Prop),
  (P -> Q) -> (Q -> R) -> P -> R.
Proof.
  auto.
Qed.

(** The [auto] tactic solves goals that are solvable by any combination of
     - [intros] and
     - [apply] (of hypotheses from the local context, by default). *)

(** Here is a more interesting example showing [auto]'s power: *)

Example auto_example_2 : forall P Q R S T U : Prop,
  (P -> Q) ->
  (P -> R) ->
  (T -> R) ->
  (S -> T -> U) ->
  ((P->Q) -> (P->S)) ->
  T ->
  P ->
  U.
Proof. auto. Qed.

(** Proof search could, in principle, take an arbitrarily long time,
    so there are limits to how far [auto] will search by default. *)

Example auto_example_3 : forall (P Q R S T U: Prop),
  (P -> Q) ->
  (Q -> R) ->
  (R -> S) ->
  (S -> T) ->
  (T -> U) ->
  P ->
  U.
Proof.
  (* When it cannot solve the goal, [auto] does nothing *)
  auto.
  (* Optional argument says how deep to search (default is 5) *)
  auto 6.
Qed.

(** [auto] considers the hypotheses in the current context
    together with a _hint database_ of other lemmas and constructors.
    Some common facts about equality and logical operators are
    installed in the hint database by default. *)

Example auto_example_4 : forall P Q R : Prop,
  Q ->
  (Q -> R) ->
  P \/ (Q /\ R).
Proof. auto. Qed.

(** If we want to see which facts [auto] is using, we can use
    [info_auto] instead. *)

Example auto_example_5: 2 = 2.
Proof.
  (* auto subsumes reflexivity because eq_refl is in hint database *)
  info_auto.
Qed.

(** We can extend the hint database just for the purposes of one
    application of [auto] by writing "[auto using ...]". *)

Lemma le_antisym : forall n m: nat, (n <= m /\ m <= n) -> n = m.
Proof. intros. omega. Qed.

Example auto_example_6 : forall n m p : nat,
  (n <= p -> (n <= m /\ m <= n)) ->
  n <= p ->
  n = m.
Proof.
  auto using le_antisym.
Qed.

(** We can also permanently extend the hint database:

      - [Hint Resolve T.]

          Add theorem or constructor [T] to the global DB

      - [Hint Constructors c.]

          Add _all_ constructors of [c] to the global DB

      - [Hint Unfold d.]

          Automatically expand defined symbol [d] during [auto]
*)

(** It is also possible to define specialized hint databases that can
    be activated only when needed.  See the Coq reference manual for
    more. *)

(** Let's take a first pass over [ceval_deterministic] to simplify the

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Searching For Hypotheses *)

(** The proof has become simpler, but there is still an annoying
    amount of repetition.

    Let's first tackle the contradiction cases.  Each occurs where we
    have hypothesis of the form

      H1: beval st b = false

    as well as:

      H2: beval st b = true

    First step: abstracting out that piece of script in Ltac.
*)

Ltac rwd H1 H2 := rewrite H1 in H2; discriminate.

(** Using [rwd]... *)

Theorem ceval_deterministic'': forall c st st1 st2,
    st =[ c ]=> st1  ->
    st =[ c ]=> st2 ->
    st1 = st2.
Proof.
  intros c st st1 st2 E1 E2.
  generalize dependent st2;
  induction E1; intros st2 E2; inversion E2; subst; auto.
  - (* E_Seq *)
    assert (st' = st'0) as EQ1 by auto.

  - (* b evaluates to true *)
    assert (st' = st'0) as EQ1 by auto.
    subst st'0.
    auto. Qed.

(** That was a bit better, but we really want Coq to discover the
    relevant hypotheses for us.  We can do this by using the [match
    goal] facility of Ltac. *)

Ltac find_rwd :=
  match goal with
    H1: ?E = true,
    H2: ?E = false
    |- _ => rwd H1 H2
  end.

(** The [match goal] tactic looks for hypotheses matching the
    pattern specified. In this case, we're looking for two equalities
    [H1] and [H2] equating the same thing [?E] to [true] and [false]. *)

Theorem ceval_deterministic''': forall c st st1 st2,
    st =[ c ]=> st1  ->
    st =[ c ]=> st2 ->
    st1 = st2.

      assert (st' = st'0) as EQ1 by auto.
      subst st'0.
      auto. Qed.

(** Now for the remaining cases. Each applies a conditional
    hypothesis to extract an equality. Let's first rephrase a bit,
    replacing our use of assertions by equivalent rewriting. *)

Theorem ceval_deterministic'''': forall c st st1 st2,
    st =[ c ]=> st1  ->
    st =[ c ]=> st2 ->
    st1 = st2.
Proof.
  intros c st st1 st2 E1 E2.
  generalize dependent st2;
  induction E1; intros st2 E2; inversion E2; subst; try find_rwd; auto.
  - (* E_Seq *)
    rewrite (IHE1_1 st'0 H1) in *. auto.
  - (* E_WhileTrue *)
    + (* b evaluates to true *)
      rewrite (IHE1_1 st'0 H3) in *. auto. Qed.

(** Now we can automate the task of finding the relevant hypotheses to
    rewrite with. *)

Ltac find_eqn :=
  match goal with
    H1: forall x, ?P x -> ?L = ?R,
    H2: ?P ?X
    |- _ => rewrite (H1 X H2) in *
  end.

(** Now we can make use of [find_eqn] to repeatedly rewrite
    with the appropriate hypothesis, wherever it may be found.

    In our example proof, we [repeat find_eqn], which will repeatedly
    rewrite until only trivial rewrites are available (since [rewrite]
    fails when given a trivial equation). *)

Theorem ceval_deterministic''''': forall c st st1 st2,
    st =[ c ]=> st1  ->

(** The big payoff in this approach is that our proof script should be
    more robust in the face of modest changes to our language.  To
    test this, let's try adding a [REPEAT] command to the language. *)

(** [REPEAT] behaves like [WHILE], except that the loop guard is
    checked _after_ each execution of the body, with the loop
    repeating as long as the guard stays _false_.  Because of this,

  - apply E_Ass. reflexivity.
  - apply E_IfFalse. reflexivity. apply E_Ass. reflexivity.
Qed.

(** In the first step of the proof, we had to explicitly provide
    a longish expression, due to the "hidden" argument [st'] to the [E_Seq]

(** If we leave out the [with], this step fails, because Coq cannot

    value for [st'] will become obvious in the very next step. *)

Proof. info_eauto. Qed.

(** The [eauto] tactic works just like [auto], except that it uses
    [eapply] instead of [apply]; [info_eauto] shows us which facts 
    [auto] uses.

    Pro tip: One might think that, since [eapply] and [eauto] are more
    powerful than [apply] and [auto], it would be a good idea to use
    them all the time.  Unfortunately, they are also significantly
    slower -- especially [eauto].  Coq experts tend to use [apply] and
    [auto] most of the time, only switching to the [e] variants when
