The easiest way to try out F* quickly is directly in your browser
using the online editor that's part of the F* tutorial:
https://www.fstar-lang.org/run.php
(and we are in the process of exposing an even cooler online editor from
 https://people.csail.mit.edu/cpitcla/fstar.js )

For people who want to get F* (v0.9.6.0-alpha1 released today)
installed on their machine there are 2 easy options:

1. Using the latest binary release
https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar/blob/master/INSTALL.md#binary-releases
https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar/releases/tag/v0.9.6.0-alpha1

2. Using the OPAM package (especially for people already using OCaml)
https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar/blob/master/INSTALL.md#opam-package

In addition, if you're familiar with emacs we recommend installing fstar-mode:
https://github.com/FStarLang/fstar-mode.el

For people who are more motivated, there are even more ways including
building things from sources. It's all documented here:
