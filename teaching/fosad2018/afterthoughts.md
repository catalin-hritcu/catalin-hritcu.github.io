You never really miunderstood something until you try to teach it
- see the TP â‡” BCC fiasco

Didn't get to some of the more interesting security related things
- secure compilation
- hyperproperties

Instead spent too much time on correct compilation and on duplication

Too many incremental steps
- Q: Did it actually help to explain the correct but insecure compiler
     in so many tiny steps. Could I have actually started with that?

Too much meta discussions about course design:
- we designed this language as a step towards this other language

Too much motivation for things that were already well motivated
- why did I need to build a broken compiler just to show that correct
  compilation doesn't imply secure compilation, when everybody was
  already trusting me on that

Some things seem already too complex
- can we further simplify?
  + e.g. stack vs register machine
  + can we show some things just on an arithmetic expression source language?
- can we push more of the complexity to later in the course?

Way too much duplication
- saying a lot of things more than once
- lots of duplication between powerpoint and madoko
- also lots of duplication between different powerpoint parts
  and between different madoko parts
- blindly reused old slides and had no real mental model of what
- sometimes even duplication within the same slide

Presentation:
- when I said things before when they were written on slides,
  I shouldn't have repeated that again when it appeared on the slide
- in general too much slide reading
